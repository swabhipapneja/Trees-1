# Time Complexity : O(n), n is no of elements in the array
# Space Complexity : O(h), where h is the height of the tree, since its a recursive solution, it uses stack implementation under the hood, and the no of elements in a stach at any time will at max be equal to the height of the tree (left subtree or right subtree)
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : NA 

# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach:
# recursive apporoach
# this approach is dependent on the inorder traversal, if sorted then BST validated
# we use a prev node to keep track of the previous node
# recursively, we check if the value of the next node is greater than the current node
# it means that the traversal is not in sorted order
# the property for inorder traversal of BST is breached and we make isvalid false
